Too many teams still operate in "feature factory" mode — shipping sprint after sprint, disconnected from whether users or the business even benefit.

**Value-driven teams flip that mindset**: their focus is on solving real problems, not completing arbitrary backlogs.

### What Makes a Team Value-Driven?

- They ask **why**, not just what and when.
- They prioritize **outcomes** over story points.
- They measure **impact**, not just delivery.

#### 🚫 NOT value-driven:
> “We finished 42 tickets this sprint.”

#### ✅ Value-driven:
> “We reduced sign-up drop-off by 18%.”

To truly embrace agility, your teams must connect daily work to real-world value — or risk becoming just another expensive delivery machine.
