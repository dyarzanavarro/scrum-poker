Ever launched a feature only to watch users ignore it completely?

That’s what happens when you **skip UX research**. Assumptions fill the gap, and those assumptions cost you — in time, trust, and churn.

### UX Research is a Non-Negotiable

- It reveals **real problems**, not stakeholder opinions.
- It helps **prioritize features** that users actually care about.
- It reduces rework by validating **before building**.

### But It’s More Than Just Surveys

- Observe behavior, don’t just ask questions.
- Pair qualitative interviews with analytics.
- Run usability tests on rough prototypes, not polished UIs.

> “Good UX is invisible — but the effort behind it shouldn’t be.”

Strong user experience isn’t decoration — it’s the difference between products people tolerate and ones they love.
