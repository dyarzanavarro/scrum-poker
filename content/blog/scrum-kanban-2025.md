In 2025, the lines between SCRUM and Kanban are increasingly blurred — and that’s a good thing.

## 🌀 SCRUM: Still Great for Planning-Heavy Teams

SCRUM remains ideal for teams that:
- Need predictable sprint planning
- Have fixed priorities during development
- Thrive on rituals like retros and reviews

> Best for: Cross-functional product teams, feature delivery squads

## 📊 Kanban: Simplicity and Flow

Kanban is thriving in 2025 for:
- Teams focused on flow and cycle time
- Infrastructure or ops teams
- Async-first organizations

> Best for: Incident response, growth experiments, devops pipelines

## 🤝 Hybrid is the Norm

Most teams today borrow from both:
- **Scrum events + Kanban board**
- **WIP limits + Sprint reviews**
- **Backlog grooming + continuous delivery**

## 🧠 Takeaway

Agile today isn’t about picking a camp — it’s about picking what fits. Your agile process should serve your team’s context, not the other way around.

Still doing 2-week sprints with a Kanban board? Good. That’s agile.
