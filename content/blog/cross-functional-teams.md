Agile isn't just about ceremonies and boards — it's about **delivering value across disciplines without handoff hell**.

Cross-functional teams bring together developers, designers, testers, product managers, and even marketing — all aligned on the same outcome. No more waiting two sprints for "the microservices team" to pick it up. No more tossing work over the wall.

### Why It Works

- **Shared goals** mean fewer blockers and misaligned incentives
- **Faster feedback loops** between design, build, and validate
- **Accountability lives with the team**, not external reviewers

> “Ship value, not tickets.”

When cross-functional teams own both the **problem** and the **solution**, they move with purpose — and results follow.
